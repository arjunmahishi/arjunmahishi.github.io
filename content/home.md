# Hi, I am Arjun <span class="wave">👋🏾</span>

I am currently a Software engineer at Last9 Inc. I
throughly enjoy the art and craft that goes behind building software. I spend
way too much time configuring my tools - especially Vim and Tmux. Love writing
clean, testable and maintainable code.


Apart from being an engineer, I'm a closeted musician. I've been playing the
guitar for a while now (since around 2009 I think). Recently I started
venturing into creating music with more than just a guitar. So, most weekends
you'll see me locked in a room, Live looping with my guitars and a MIDI
keyboard. If you are interested to see some of those, head over to

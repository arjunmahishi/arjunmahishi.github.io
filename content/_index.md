My name is Arjun Mahishi. I am currently a Software engineer at [Last9 Inc](https://last9.io). I throughly enjoy the art and craft that goes behind building software. I spend way too much time [configuring my tools](https://github.com/arjunmahishi/dotfiles) - especially Vim and Tmux. Love writing clean, testable and maintainable code.

Apart from being an engineer, I'm a closeted musician. I've been playing the guitar for a while now (since around 2009 I think). Recently I started venturing into creating music with more than just a guitar. So, most weekends you'll see me locked in a room, Live looping with my guitars and a MIDI keyboard. If you are interested to see some of these live loops and some regular covers, head over to [arjunmahishi.mp3](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9eTgNyhtPaVf7h-YEo-R2w)

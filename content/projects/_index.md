### [pxp](https://github.com/arjunmahishi/pxp)

A simple CLI tool to explore metrics stored in a prometheus based storage like
Victoria metrics, M3db, Prometheus itself (obviously) etc. This is **still a
work in progress**. It is not at all usable for now. I am trying to bake in a
lot of suggestions/auto-complete to improve the UX of **exploring** metrics. If
this works, it could be a great alternative to using grafana's metrics explorer

### [flow.nvim](https://arjunmahishi.com/flow.nvim/)

A lightweight neovim plugin to quickly run a snippet of code (in the context of the current
file you're editing) without ever leaving neovim. Gives you a slight boost in productivity by
helping you automate parts of your development workflow. Has a pretty cool integration with telescope

### [loadbalancer in Go](https://github.com/arjunmahishi/loadbalancer-in-go)

A very minimal loadbalancer built from scratch in Go. This was build only to
learn how load balancers work and also to exercise some Go skills

### [type-test](https://arjunmahishi.com/type-test/)

A web app to practice and measure your typing speed. I worked on this to learn React :P

Github: https://github.com/arjunmahishi/type-test

### [guineapig](https://github.com/arjunmahishi/guineapig)

A simple HTTP server that echos all requests it receives. Useful for manually
testing outbound HTTP requests of an application. Additionally, it can also be
configured to send custom responses for the requests it receives 

Github: https://github.com/arjunmahishi/guineapig

### [instify](https://github.com/xlogix/instify)

An android app that let's you plan how many classes you can bunk, without
getting detained (< 75% attendance). This app had become pretty viral in our
collage. It also had other features like viewing your timetable, exam results
etc (the official collage website sucked)

Github: https://github.com/xlogix/instify

### [Chord progression generator](https://github.com/arjunmahishi/chord-progression-generator)

A python script that generates Major/Minor chord progressions any key of
choice. Dont judge the code, this is one of the first pieces of proper code I
wrote :P

There are countless more projects that I've tinkered on. Can't list them all here. These are the ones that I'm pretty proud of

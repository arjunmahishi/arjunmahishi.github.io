# Hi, I am Arjun <span class="wave">👋🏾</span>

I am a Software engineer and a closet musician 

I 🖤 building software. Especially tools ⚒️. Tools that automagically solve
people's problems (mostly engineering problems). What I like about building tools
the most is, you can never predict how they will be used. It could become a
building block in a bigger script ⚙️, a link in a chain of shell commands 🔗, or
run independently on its own 🚀. Building such tools comes with its own set of
exciting challenges and is an art in itself

I am currently working on observability at [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/).

Also, I obsessively keep tweaking my neovim + tmux setup 🔨. If you use/want to use
either of these tools, we will get along pretty well 🤝🏽

Apart from Software, I spend a large part of my weekends making and listening
to music 🎵. I've been playing the guitar since I was 11 🎸. I am no David Gilmore,
but over the years I've gotten comfortable enough with the instrument to
replicate what I hear and put my spin on it 👾.

For the past couple of years, I've been experimenting with electronic music too. I
use a little 2 Octave MIDI keyboard to sample sounds and create music out of it 🎹.
This combined with the guitar is my favorite pass time.

It was probably the best year so far. I would not\nchange a thing about it. Travelled to interesting places, ran, hiked, met\ngoals, and did so much more. Unlike the previous years, I spent a lot of time\noutdoors. Writing this post to remember some of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#work\">Work</a></h2>\n<p>Joined <a href=\"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/\">Cockroach Labs</a> in October of last\nyear (2023). This was probably a pivotal decision that made this year so great. The\nwork culture here made me realise that I can do fulfilling work without\ncompletely burning out.</p>\n<p>I got to do a lot of interesting work this year on the various observability\ntools that are used for monitoring/debugging cockroachDB. I did a lot of work\naround the <a href=\"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cockroach-debug-zip\">debug zip</a> command,\ninstrumentation lib, logging etc.</p>\n<p>Apart from the main line of work, I took part in an internal leader board for\nthe <a href=\"https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc\">1 billion row challenge</a>. That was\na lot of fun and I got to learn A LOT from this experience. I was able to get\nthe runtime from 3mins to just over 2 seconds. But because the bar is so high\nat Cockroach Labs, I was only able to get 8th place ðŸ˜….</p>\n<p>There is still so much to learn and do at Cockroach Labs. I am looking forward\nto the coming year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"health\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#health\">Health</a></h2>\n<p>Last year, I got a health checkup done and found out that I had high\ncholesterol and glucose resistance. This really scared the shit out of me. So,\nI decided to take health more seriously and started running.</p>\n<p>In the beginning, it was very hard. My endurance really sucked. I hated\nrunning. But eventually, I got a hang of it and started to enjoy it. So far\nthis year, I've run almost 300Km. I even took part in my first 10k run.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"flex\" style=\"overflow-x: auto; height: 17rem; gap: 1rem; justify-content: space-around;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/medal.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"></div><p></p>\n<p>From the past few weeks, I've also started to do some strength training. Over\nthe course of this year, I was able to drop around 10Kg of weight. And more\nimportantly, I don't have high cholesterol and glucose resistance anymore ðŸŽ‰</p>\n<p>My current goal with running is to be able to run 5k within 35min. This is a\nfitness requirement for most of the Himalayan trek organised by <a href=\"https://indiahikes.com/\">IndiaHikes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"travel\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#travel\">Travel</a></h2>\n<h4 id=\"kashmir\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#kashmir\">Kashmir</a></h4>\n<p>I went to Kashmir with my family in March. The timing was perfect. It was the\nbeginning of spring and still got to see snow. This was my first time seeing\nsnow. The highlight of this trip for me was the stay in Gulmarg and the hike to\nthe Thajiwas Glacier in Sonmarg.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"flex\" style=\"overflow-x: auto; height: 17rem; gap: 1rem; justify-content: space-around;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/kashmir-3.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/kashmir-1.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/kashmir-2.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"></div><p></p>\n<h4 id=\"canada\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#canada\">Canada</a></h4>\n<p>Got to go to Canada for the company's RnD offsite. The offsite was for 3 day in\nToronto. For the 3 days, there was enough to do in Toronto apart from the\nofficial programming of the offsite. We mostly walked around the city and\nvisited touristy places like the distillery district, steam whistle brewery,\netc. On one of the days, we went to see the Niagara falls. This was my first\ntime travelling outside of India. I really enjoyed the first world experience.\nThe company put us up in the <a href=\"https://www.fourseasons.com/toronto/\">Four Seasons Hotel</a>.\nThe hotel was just amazing. The food was great, the view from my room was\ngreat. I really enjoyed my stay there.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"flex\" style=\"overflow-x: auto; height: 17rem; gap: 1rem; justify-content: space-around;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/toronto-1.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/toronto-2.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/toronto-3.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/toronto-4.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"></div><p></p>\n<p>After the offsite, a few of us took a couple of days off and went to Banff in\nAlberta. This was the highlight of the trip. The place is just so beautiful. We\nwent to some of the blue lakes, hiked a bit, and mostly just walked around the\ntown. The hostel we stayed in was 5min away from the bow river. The views were\nspectacular from every corner of the town.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"flex\" style=\"overflow-x: auto; height: 17rem; gap: 1rem; justify-content: space-around;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/banff-1.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/banff-2.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/banff-3.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><img src=\"/img/2024-wrapped/banff-4.jpg\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"></div><p></p>\n<h2 id=\"hiking\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#hiking\">Hiking</a></h2>\n<p>This year, I did not leave any opportunity to go hiking. I found this amazing\ncommunity of hikers in Bangalore called <a href=\"https://blrhikes.com/\">BLR Hikes</a>\nwhich is run by <a href=\"https://x.com/shreshthmohan\">Shreshth Mohan</a>. I went on\nseveral hikes with them around Bangalore. This made me realise how easy it is\ngo get away from civilization for a little bit and just be with nature.</p>\n<p>Outside of Bangalore, I went on 2 treks in the Western Ghats. The first one was\nto <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudremukh\">Kudremukh</a> and the second one was\nto <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumara_Parvatha\">Kumara Parvatha</a>. Kudremukh\nwas my favourite of the two. It was during the monsoon season. It was lush\ngreen and there were multiple streams of crystal clear water that you could\ndrink from. The trek was medium-hard difficulty. The views towards the summit\nwere amazing. Kumara Parvatha was much harder. Most of the group I went with\n(including me) did not make it to the summit. We reach Shesha Parvatha which is\nabout 1km away from the summit and decided to turn back because it was getting\ndark. This trek was very humbling ðŸ˜….</p>\n<p>I also did a couple of hikes in Banff and Kashmir which were great. Hikes\naround Bangalore are nice, but the hikes in Alpine regions are something else.\nIn this coming years, I want to do some of the more challenging hikes in the\nHimalayas.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Distance</th>\n<th>Elevation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Sat, 11/30/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/13019697094\">Kumara parvatha (almost)</a></td>\n<td>5:40:00</td>\n<td>17.40 km</td>\n<td>1,462 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sat, 10/12/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/12640971604\">Kudremukha</a></td>\n<td>7:00:09</td>\n<td>20.18 km</td>\n<td>869 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sun, 10/6/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/12586748181\">The hill behind Rasta cafe</a></td>\n<td>1:22:23</td>\n<td>4.31 km</td>\n<td>196 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sun, 8/25/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/12235294566\">Hari hara betta</a></td>\n<td>1:12:57</td>\n<td>3.11 km</td>\n<td>141 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sat, 7/27/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11997011688\">Johnston canyon</a></td>\n<td>1:17:34</td>\n<td>6.28 km</td>\n<td>178 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fri, 7/26/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11989893704\">Afternoon Hike</a></td>\n<td>51:24</td>\n<td>3.45 km</td>\n<td>0 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fri, 7/26/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11988090862\">Moraine lake rock pile</a></td>\n<td>19:26</td>\n<td>1.18 km</td>\n<td>18 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thu, 7/25/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11982415353\">Sulphur mountain - cosmic ray station</a></td>\n<td>22:44</td>\n<td>1.35 km</td>\n<td>62 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sat, 6/15/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11655575475\">Handhi Gundi Trek</a></td>\n<td>2:03:07</td>\n<td>7.15 km</td>\n<td>344 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sun, 4/21/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11246925115\">Tenginakallu</a></td>\n<td>2:10:00</td>\n<td>5.00 km</td>\n<td>0 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thu, 3/28/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11053186016\">Hari parbat fort</a></td>\n<td>31:00</td>\n<td>2.08 km</td>\n<td>98 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wed, 3/27/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11047151428\">Thajiwas glacier</a></td>\n<td>55:32</td>\n<td>3.09 km</td>\n<td>43 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sun, 2/25/2024</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/10833198121\">Bidarkatte trek</a></td>\n<td>2:11:28</td>\n<td>7.22 km</td>\n<td>220m</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"music\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#music\">Music</a></h2>\n<p>Having spent a lot of my free time outdoors this year, I could not spend much\ntime on the music front. But I did perform in two open mics at the <a href=\"https://indianmusicexperience.org/\">Indian\nMusic Experience</a>. Apart from this, I\nuploaded 3 covers on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@arjunmahishi.mp3\">Youtube channel</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/k5kGou2KEcM\">Pneuma (by Tool) on a classical guitar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/E2crH8OpNqU\">The Humbling River - Puscifer | Acoustic + MIDI cover</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/PukkjgjrENA\">By And Down The River - A Perfect Circle | Guitar/MIDI Cover</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are a fan of progressive rock/metal, you will probably notice a pattern\nin the above songs ðŸ˜›. Tool and Maynard James Keenan's world is one of the best\ndiscoveries I made this year. I'd listen to Tool before but never really got\ninto it. But this year, I got obsessed with them. It's amazing how much depth\nthere is in their music both lyrically and musically. I've listened to\ntechnically proficient music before, but Tool also manages to be very emotional\nand spiritual. I've never felt so connected to music like this before.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>These were some of the highlights of 2024. I am looking forward to the coming\nyear with a few minor goals in mind. See you in 2025!</p>\n</body></html>","title":"2024 wrapped","date":"2024-12-01","tags":["personal"],"toc":true,"readTime":"7 min read"}},"__N_SSG":true}

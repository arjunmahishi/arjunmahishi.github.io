{"pageProps":{"data":{"contentHTML":"<h1>Hi, I am Arjun <span class=\"wave\">👋🏾</span></h1>\n<p>I am a Software engineer and a closet musician</p>\n<p>I 🖤 building software. Especially tools ⚒️. Tools that automagically solve\npeople's problems (mostly engineering problems). What I like about building tools\nthe most is, you can never predict how they will be used. It could become a\nbuilding block in a bigger script ⚙️, a link in a chain of shell commands 🔗, or\nrun independently on its own 🚀. Building such tools comes with its own set of\nexciting challenges and is an art in itself</p>\n<p>I am currently doing exactly that at <a href=\"https://last9.io/\">Last9</a> 🏢</p>\n<p>Also, I obsessively keep tweaking my vim + tmux setup 🔨. If you use/want to use\neither of these, we will get along pretty well 🤝🏽</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Apart from Software, I spend a large part of my weekends making and listening\nto music 🎵. I've been playing the guitar since I was 11 🎸. I am no David Gilmore,\nbut over the years I've gotten comfortable enough with the instrument to\nreplicate what I hear and put my spin on it 👾.</p>\n<p>For the past couple of years, I've been experimenting with electronic music. I\nuse a little 2 Octave MIDI keyboard to sample sounds and create music out of it 🎹.\nThis combined with the guitar is my favorite pass time.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}

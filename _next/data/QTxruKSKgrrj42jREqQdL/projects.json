This helps navigate some of the k8s resources and their\ndetails with the UX of neovim. I built this plugin because I thought the idea\nwas cool. This may seem like a bad idea at first. But some things like, slicing\nand dicing logs, reading config files with interpolated values</p>\n<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/arjunmahishi/k8s.nvim\">https://github.com/arjunmahishi/k8s.nvim</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/arjunmahishi/pxp\">pxp</a></h3>\n<p><em>(Sept 2022)</em></p>\n<p>A simple CLI tool to explore metrics stored in a prometheus based storage like\nVictoria metrics, M3db, Prometheus itself (obviously) etc. This is <strong>still a\nwork in progress</strong>. It is not at all usable for now. I am trying to bake in a\nlot of suggestions/auto-complete to improve the UX of <strong>exploring</strong> metrics. If\nthis works, it could be a great alternative to using grafana's metrics explorer</p>\n<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/arjunmahishi/pxp\">https://github.com/arjunmahishi/pxp</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a href=\"https://arjunmahishi.com/flow.nvim/\">flow.nvim</a></h3>\n<p><em>(Nov 2021)</em></p>\n<p>A lightweight neovim plugin to quickly run a snippet of code (in the context of the current\nfile you're editing) without ever leaving neovim. Gives you a slight boost in productivity by\nhelping you automate parts of your development workflow.

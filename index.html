        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        <p>DOB: 11 JUNE 1996</p>

        <p>Living and breathing software design and development since early high school days. I thoroughly enjoy the process of building a product from scratch. My choice of getting into the field of computer science was not driven by future scope or current buzz words. But rather by pure passion and curiosity.</p>
        <p>I have worked with a few startups and co-founded one of my own called <a href="https://fnplus.xyz/">Fnplus</a>.</p>
        <p>My major focus is on the web platform and I am obsessed with web performance. I feel that the web is the future of software distribution as it is already available accross all platforms and devices.</p>

[{"content":"couple of days ago writing program go ran into able quickly fix it google search which landed on but didn\u0026rsquot explain what init loop is why occurs so this post attempt example trying compile above code will give you error main.go42 initialization tmp test globalfunc refers main.go96 func1 main.go136 func2 looking at message should be quite clear creating problem not referencing things while initializing compiler can\u0026rsquot decide initialize first that\u0026rsquos refuses throws understand you\u0026rsquoll need order initializes imported packages globally declared variables constants function within global depends references if one variable another referenced initialized here because are dependant each other they when dependency forms like snippet how do we solution enter can enforced using that means just done corrected would look something simpler probably very fundamental obvious concept many people encountered for time thought mini blog about help me hopefully more golang noobs little better spot mistake i\u0026rsquove explained or see typo thanks

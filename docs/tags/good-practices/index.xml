      <description>This week I ran into a bug with an empty interface{} which highlighted a smell in the code. This post describes what the bug is, how I fixed it, and the lessons learned.
The Bug We found a couple of recovered panics in the logs. These panics were happening pretty frequently. This is what the panic message said:
 panic: interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not []*typeName
 From the panic message, it is pretty obvious that somewhere in the code we are trying to convert an interface{} to a specific array type when the value is actually nil.</description>

      <description>Straight from the documentation:
 Stringer is a tool to automate the creation of methods that satisfy the fmt.Stringer interface. Given the name of a (signed or unsigned) integer type T that has constants defined, stringer will create a new self-contained Go source file implementing:
func (t T) String() string The file is created in the same package and directory as the package that defines T. It has helpful defaults designed for use with go generate.</description>

      <description>Testing â€” An activity hated by most human beings Testing is an investigation done to make sure that the code we have written is reliable and meets the given requirements. The most common way to test code is to write unit tests for different units of the codebase. This makes it easy to isolate the bugs. All of the software development processes include testing as an integral part. The one we are going to talk about today is called Test Driven Development or TDD in short.</description>

      <description>Straight from the documentation:
 Stringer is a tool to automate the creation of methods that satisfy the fmt.Stringer interface. Given the name of a (signed or unsigned) integer type T that has constants defined, stringer will create a new self-contained Go source file implementing:
func (t T) String() string The file is created in the same package and directory as the package that defines T. It has helpful defaults designed for use with go generate.</description>

All of the software development processes include testing as an integral part. The one we are going to talk about today is called Test Driven Development or TDD in short.</description>
